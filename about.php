 <p> Who are we?  Let me introduce myself- My name is Alyssa and I am a third quarter student in the Web Design program at Seattle Central College.  I have worked as a Behavorist in academia for the past 10 years.  I have been searching for a career that would marry my passion for behavior and creative nature into a dream calling.  I then discovered the world of UX Design and Research. </p>
<p> Rick Lipscomb is an architect with 20 + years in design and current founding partner of WHLC Architects.  They currently have 3 firms across Louisina, Mississippi and the Alabama Gulf Coast. Rick and I will be teaming up to branch out with new construction utilizing refurbished materials.  This combines my passion for rustic design with Rick's architectural expertise.
