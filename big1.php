<main> <h1>BIG Project Research: Flexboxes</h1>

	When designing a website layout, there are many factors to consider.  Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and Hypertext  Markup Language (HTML) determine the structure and display to personalize and design websites.  Unless you are designing a very simplistic site without much content or sections, you typically see floating of content in boxes to achieve the desired layout.  However, there is a newer option that is mostly browser supported at this time, known as the flexbox layout.  The Flexbugs site is a helpful resource to ensure compatibility with old versions of browsers (MDN Web Docs). This option allows for complete control of alignment, direction, order, and size (Interneting is Hard).  Flex items or flex containers can be created for ultimate control of your layout.  Flex items can also serve as containers for the content inside of them. 

  	To float content in CSS, the items are displayed as block and floated right or left to determine its location on the page.  In flexbox CSS, items are displayed as flex, and the justify-content values are center, flex-start, flex-end, space-around, or space-between. Another option here, is using the align-items values of center, flex-start, flex-end, stretch, and baseline (Interneting is Hard). The opportunities with flex far surpass that of float and will continue to grow and change.  As the designer, it is important to experiment with the different values to get a feel for how the content and containers interact with one another. This field is incredibly exciting as it offers continual growth, options for creativity, and the reward of seeing your work come to fruition.
